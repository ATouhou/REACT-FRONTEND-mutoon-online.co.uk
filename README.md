#Mutoon-Online.Co.Uk


Mutoon online is a platform for reading, listening and memorizing mutoon.

What is Matn? What are the Mutoon? 

The word Matn simply means (text,small book) and the plural form of that word is mutoon meaning text(s) small books.

We have chosen to focus on memorizing and understanding the mutoon as they discuss the basics ever Muslim must know. Futhermore, they are gems to be kept close for those striving on the path of seeking knowledge.
